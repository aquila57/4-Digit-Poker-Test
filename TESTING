Testing instructions for the 4 digit poker programs in this
repository.

Read REFERENCES for information about the 4 digit poker test.

--------

Program by program testing instructions.

Fibonacci random number generator

Run fibopokr to apply the 4 digit poker test to the fibonacci
random number generator.  There is no parameter.

./fibopokr

This program is expected to pass the test.

--------

64 bit LFSR random number generator

Run lfsrpokr to apply the 4 digit poker test to the 64 bit
LFSR random number generator.  There is no parameter.

./lfsrpokr

This program is expected to pass the test.

--------

32 bit RANDU random number generator

Run randu to apply the 4 digit poker test to the 32 bit
RANDU random number generator.  There is no parameter.

./rupoker

This program is expected to pass the test.

--------

Sine wave random number generator

Run sinepokr to apply the 4 digit poker test to the sine
wave random number generator.  There is no parameter.

./sinepokr

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

eegl64 random number generator

Run poker to apply the 4 digit poker test to the eegl64
uniform random number generator.  There is one parameter.

./poker

This test is expected to pass the chi square test.

--------

etaus random number generator

Run etauspokr to apply the 4 digit poker test to the etaus
uniform random number generator.  There is no parameter.

./etauspokr

This test is expected to pass the chi square test.

--------

GNU Scientific Library random number generators


Run tstgsl.sh to apply the 4 digit poker test to the GNU
Scientific Library collection of random number generators.
There is one parameter, the name of the GSL generator.

./tstgsl.sh RNG_name 

Where RNG_name is the name of the generator.

Example:

./tstgsl.sh taus2

This example runs the 4 digit poker test on the GSL taus2
random number generator.

To find a list of valid GSL random number generators, enter
a parameter that produces an error.

./tstgsl.sh ?

This test is expected to pass the chi square test for all
the GSL generators.

To run a test of all GSL generators, run runall.sh.

./runall.sh

Read the results of this test by browsing allgsl.out.
This test reads allgsl.lst as an input file.

--------

Dieharder package random number generators

Run tstdie.sh to apply the 4 digit poker test to the
dieharder collection of random number generators.  There
is one parameter, the id of the dieharder generator.

./tstdie.sh RNG_number

Example,

./tstdie.sh 053

This example runs the 4 digit poker test on the dieharder
taus2 random number generator.

To find a list of valid dieharder random number generators,
enter the following dieharder command.

dieharder -g -l

This test is expected to pass the chi square test for all
of the random number generators.

To run a test of all dieharder generators, run dieall.sh.

./dieall.sh

Read the results of this test by browsing alldie.out.
This test reads alldie.lst as an input file.
